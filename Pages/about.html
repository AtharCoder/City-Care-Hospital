            <h1>Hospital History</h1>
            <p>City Care Hospital was founded in 2005 with a simple yet powerful vision: to deliver compassionate,
                high-quality healthcare to every member of our community. What began as a small clinic with just five
                beds has grown into a state-of-the-art medical facility serving over 50,000 patients annually. Over the
                years, we have expanded our services, invested in cutting-edge technology, and built a team of dedicated
                doctors, nurses, and support staff who share a common commitment to excellence. Our growth reflects our
                deep roots in the community and our unwavering focus on patient-centered care.</p>
